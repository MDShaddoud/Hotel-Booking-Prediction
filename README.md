# Hotel-Booking-Prediction
This project is about building a Machine Learning model to predict hotel bookings. It uses Python and various Machine Learning techniques such as supervised learning, feature engineering, and model selection. 
# Introduction 
This project is aimed at creating a machine learning model to predict hotel bookings. It will use Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression to train and evaluate the model. The goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately predict hotel bookings based on input features such as location, hotel type, and number of days.
